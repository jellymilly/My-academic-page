# About Me 
I am a postgraduate student in the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/).
I work in the Sleep Lab, supervised by [Dr Maria Gardani](http://https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/mariagardani/) and [Prof Stephany Biello](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/stephanybiello/). 
I completed my undergrdauate degree in Psychology with a First Class Honours degree at the University of Glasgow in 2018. Previously, I worked as a lecturer in Academic English, primary teacher, translator and journalist. As someone who has lucky enough to enjoy a portfolio career spanning two decades and four countries, I am pashionate about international collaboration, freedom of movement and knowledge exchange. My research interests include student mental health and well-being, sleep and body-focused repetitive behaviours. I use quantitative and qualitative researh methods and my projects are pre-registered with PROSEPRO and Open Science Framework websites. I enjoy dedicating my free time to volunteernig at hospitals, care homes and university halls and events with my therapet dog Pixie.
