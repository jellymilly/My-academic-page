I completed my undergrdauate degree in Psychology with a First Class Honours degree at the University of Glasgow in 2018. Previously, I worked as a lecturer in Academic English, primary teacher, translator and journalist. Having been lucky enough to enjoy a portfolio career spanning two decades and four countries, I am passionate about international collaboration, freedom of movement and knowledge exchange. My research interests include student mental health and well-being, sleep and body-focused repetitive behaviours. I use quantitative and qualitative research methods and my projects are pre-registered with [PROSEPRO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) and [Open Science Framework](http://help.osf.io/m/registrations/l/524205-register-your-project) websites. I enjoy dedicating my free time to volunteernig in hospitals, care homes and university halls and events with my therapet dog Pixie.
