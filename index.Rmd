#**About Me**
I am a postgraduate student in the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/). This year, I have received a scholarship from the University of Glasgow [Research and Innovation Servies](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/ris/) to study postgraduate student mental health and well-being, supervised by [Dr Maria Gardani](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/mariagardani/) and [Prof Stephany Biello](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/stephanybiello/).

I have completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology with a First Class Honours degree at the University of Glasgow in 2018. I am currently doing an MSc in Resarch Methods, hoping to progress onto a PhD next year. Previously, I have worked as a lecturer in Academic English, primary teacher, translator and journalist. Having been lucky enough to enjoy a portfolio career spanning two decades and four countries, I am passionate about international collaboration, freedom of movement and knowledge exchange. My research interests include student mental health and well-being, sleep and body-focused repetitive behaviours. Having used qualitative methodology in my previous project on Trichotillomania and personal relationships, I am now emplying mixed methods to study student mental health. As a firm believer in transparency and open science, my projects are registered or currently undergoing pre-registration on [PROSEPRO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=72914) and [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/myprojects/) websites. I enjoy dedicating my free time to volunteernig in hospitals and care homes with my therapet dog Pixie. And to Sunday catch-up brunches that last until dinner.
